# Listening React Frontend Live Coding Interview

This is a boilerplate Vite + Typescript + React project. We'll be using it for a live coding exercise during your interview.

## Before the Interview

Clone the repo locally and ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm i`). Make sure you can run the development server (`npm run dev`). You're welcome to install additional dependencies if you like, though this is not required or expected.

Please make sure you're familiar with the following:

-   React function components
-   Common React hooks
-   React state management
-   Basic Tailwind CSS

## During the Interview

**DO**

-   Share your entire screen with us (code editor and web browser)
-   Ask lots of clarifying questions and ensure you understand the question
-   Explain your approach before you begin coding
-   Talk out loud so we know what you're doing and why
-   Use Google, Stack Overflow, etc. as much as you need

**DO NOT**

-   Use ChatGPT or any other LLM
-   Use Copilot, or any other AI coding tool (please disable them before the interview)

## Example Questions

- Add a right-aligned "login" button to the top navbar. When clicked, the text of the button should toggle between "login" and "logout"
- Using the HTTP client of your choice (e.g. `fetch`), request the contents of `https://dummyjson.com/products` and display the raw JSON result in the UI.
